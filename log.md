### Day 4: March 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Grids and Flexbox and had clear view about the grid layouts and completed first project of FreeCodeCamp FrontEnd Certification

**Thoughts** I am still feeling like I am going slow and steady. I really need to speed up the pace of learning. I got to learn about grids and its power in layout designing

### Day 10: March 16, Monday

### Day 11: March 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I am into the ES6 session where I got to refresh my memories and learn new things. It's really helping me to create a strong base. I got little confused with the Recursion proplem and taking random numbers from any given range. I am still working in this. I got it some how but I am still a litttttle bit confused.

**Thoughts** I really had a great conversation with new developers from the thread of my last nights tweet about the issues I had in one of the coding challenges. It was really amazing to get a chance to share my views with other senior developers

### Day 12: March 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started RegEx in JS and I am kinda loving this approach which is very much helpful in searching and rearranging data in algorithm designing

**Thoughts** I again got to interract with other developers in twitter. Theres high alert all around the world about the CORONA virus which is COVID-19. Here again I didn't get enough time to explore my domain. I am plannig to ask for a provision to work from home at office so I might be able to save some time of going in bus and waiting in long lines and invest in my own research

### Day 15: March 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed basic data structure problems and now working on basic algorithm scripting in js from FreeCodeCamp. Its really interesting and amazing course indeed

**Thoughts** I know I am late at the commit but I haven't stopped my learning. I was only late in pushing my commit. As I was shifting my platform from Linux back to Windows :"( I am not a evil but I was kinda missing the GUI feelings and also I was plannig to start using UNTY so that pulled me back to Windows. And all my push above this was from Linux except first three. I am back to Windows so I though the repo was not in sink and I was screwed but SSH saved me. I still do lack Git knowledge. Its already Day 15 and as for my plan. I am planning to go for React after completing this course along with basic game dev in JS and webGL

### Day 16: March 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Object-Oriented Programming form JavaScript and got to learn how to prototype chain works in JS and also got to know about Closure and IIFE and lot more. Due to heavy rainfall and powercut, I was unable to update my last nights' tweet

**Thoughts** Everything is fuzzy ,,,..... -\_- due to powercut and heavy rainfall I lost my data so ...

### Day 17: March 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Played around with Canvas and 2d shapes exploration. On the mission to do some physics simulation using canvas shapes

**Thoughts** I am planning to do some c# programming. But still I am not able to clearly visualize my path. I want to learn one JS framework and also game development. SO I am little confused about how to take those in parallel.

### Day 18: March 24, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I got to learn all the potentials of functional programming in JavaScript. Also learned how we can optimize our code a little. Also completed functional programming section of JavaScript Algorithm and DataSctructure. So currently working in intermediatte level of Algorithm Scripting

**Thoughts** I am planning to dive into the world of game development now. This time I am trying new approach to learn things. All these years I tried to grab all the necesary skillset that I feel enough and then only I started doing some projects. But this time I am directly making my hands dirty and then I will search for essential cure.

### Day 19: March 25, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I got to revise my another canvas art ie. gravity simulation. It is really cool how we get to code all the physics simulation but although it is cool and I really wanna make one of my own game engine from scratch, that would be too far. I completed few of the problems of Algorithm Scripting. May be a quater of all.

**Thoughts** I started using blender and also installed unity3d in my machine. One thing that I am lagging is my machine's potential. It doesn't have a dedicated GPU which will show some laggy graphics if we try to render 3D models. :"( I am so disappointed, but not discouraged :) I will somehow manage the work and limit my 3D modeling till I get my new PC until then I will work on 2D games and sprite designs. Also I need to work on React and Node and Express. Maaan I got my hands so full

### Day 20: March 26, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I am near to complete all the Data Structure and algorithm problems in JS form FreeCodeCamp. Solving these kind of problem is soo much fun. I really got to learn a lot of things. Today finally after 20 days of my coding adventure I came to realize I am able to scratch the surface now. :) I am really happy from this progress and I promise I won't let this curve go down. ;)

**Thoughts** It is a time of crisis and everyone is in their own home in quarantine. I still got a looooong list of new things to explore and master. Though "master" is a whole new thing. I just wanna be very flexible and fluent to do cool stuffs in those technologies

### Day 21: March 27, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finally completed all the data structure challenges from FreeCodeCamp JavaScript session. Now by the end of tomorrow evening I am planning to get that second certificate from FreeCodeCamp and also start on FrontEnd libraries session where I'll get to learn about React. I am so excited about this section.

**Thoughts** I am really upset today as I was really excited to learn Unity and Blender, today I downloaded one demo project from Unity store and tried to load in my machine and learn something by tweaking the settings, but sadly my pc was not able to handle all the heavy graphical pressure. This hurts more than a break up. Here I was so excited to start my world of game development from today. I am temporarily postponing my Blender and Unity tranining till I get my new pc sooner or later
