### Day 11: March 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I am into the ES6 session where I got to refresh my memories and learn new things. It's really helping me to create a strong base. I got little confused with the Recursion proplem and taking random numbers from any given range. I am still working in this. I got it some how but I am still a litttttle bit confused.

**Thoughts** I really had a great conversation with new developers from the thread of my last nights tweet about the issues I had in one of the coding challenges. It was really amazing to get a chance to share my views with other senior developers

### Day 12: March 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started RegEx in JS and I am kinda loving this approach which is very much helpful in searching and rearranging data in algorithm designing

**Thoughts** I again got to interract with other developers in twitter. Theres high alert all around the world about the CORONA virus which is COVID-19. Here again I didn't get enough time to explore my domain. I am plannig to ask for a provision to work from home at office so I might be able to save some time of going in bus and waiting in long lines and invest in my own research

### Day 15: March 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed basic data structure problems and now working on basic algorithm scripting in js from FreeCodeCamp. Its really interesting and amazing course indeed

**Thoughts** I know I am late at the commit but I haven't stopped my learning. I was only late in pushing my commit. As I was shifting my platform from Linux back to Windows :"( I am not a evil but I was kinda missing the GUI feelings and also I was plannig to start using UNTY so that pulled me back to Windows. And all my push above this was from Linux except first three. I am back to Windows so I though the repo was not in sink and I was screwed but SSH saved me. I still do lack Git knowledge. Its already Day 15 and as for my plan. I am planning to go for React after completing this course along with basic game dev in JS and webGL

### Day 17: March 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Played around with Canvas and 2d shapes exploration. On the mission to do some physics simulation using canvas shapes

**Thoughts** I am planning to do some c# programming. But still I am not able to clearly visualize my path. I want to learn one JS framework and also game development. SO I am little confused about how to take those in parallel.
