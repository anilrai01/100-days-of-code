# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - [Anil]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge for this round. Started on [April 1, Wednesday, 2020].

### Day 26: April 1, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed SASS course and finally I started Unity3D game development. It's soo much fun and the way Unity allow us to attach gravity in our game object is soo cool. Now we need to only focus on the beauty and logic of the game rather than coding gravity which would be much more challenging and fun but it save our time and our complexity.

**Thoughts** Today's my Birthday, also these days there's a lockdown all over the city. We are not allowed to go out on such time, Though my sis tried to go bring some ingredients to bake me a cake. That was so sweet of her, hahahaha only wot elpoepl hsiw em. Thats fine, I have really high goal and mindset now. I won't stop and I wont give up that easily. I am planning to do my own start up with one of my friends , may be couple of. Lets see what comes
